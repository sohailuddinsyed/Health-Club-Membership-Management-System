##  Health Club Membership Management System:
 The Health Club Membership Management System is designed to streamline the processes
 involved in managing memberships, tracking attendance, and ensuring timely access to
 facilities for both members and employees. The system allows users to register, renew
 memberships, track attendance, and manage member details.
 
 At a high level, the system is designed with a client-server architecture where the client interface
 provides ease of use for both members and employees, and the server side handles data
 management, security, and processing. The system follows an agile development process,
 where deliverables are iteratively refined based on feedback and collaboration across team
 members.
 
 In this phase of development, we focused on defining atomic requirements, modeling use
 cases, and developing metrics to assess both system performance and team progress.
 Modeling use cases is essential for visualizing how different actors, such as members and
 employees, interact with the system. This approach enables the team to identify potential issues
 and refine workflows early on. By developing metrics, we can maintain standards and track the
 development process effectively, identify areas that need optimization, and support organized
 team management. Additionally, we have established a glossary of key terms to ensure
 consistent terminology across the project documentation. This phase lays the foundational
 groundwork for building a well-structured and effective system

## Compile and Run:

- Navigate to the root project directory in the terminal.
- Compile the entire project:
```shell
javac main/Main.java -d out
```
This compiles all .java files, preserving their package structure inside the out folder.
- Run the application:
```shell
java -cp out main.Main
```
Replace out with the folder where your compiled .class files are located, if different.
